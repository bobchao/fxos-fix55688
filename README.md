# fxos-fix55688
An add-on that make 55688.com.tw works better in Firefox OS devices

## Install

With WebIDE in Firefox Nightly, you can install the cloned source code to your FxOS devices (2.5+).

## How to use?

1. Add https://web55688.55688.com.tw/TII_FRONTSTAGE/APPS/Booking/CallCarNormalTGDS.aspx to your homescreen.
2. Open the webpage without the add-on, its unusable on both functional and visual part.
3. Install and enable this add-on, ta-da!
